# 📘 C# Studies Repository

Welcome to my C# studies repository! Here, you will find a collection of exercises, projects, and notes from my journey learning C#.

## 🖥️ What is C#?

C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It is used for a wide range of applications, from web development to desktop applications and games. C# is known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility, making it an ideal language for beginners and experienced developers alike. With its strong support for OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) principles, C# enables developers to create flexible, scalable, and maintainable code.
